# UARTUART Fundamentals

U – Universal: Applicable across diverse devices
<br>
A – Asynchronous: No clock line is shared
R – Receiver, T – Transmitter
Uses a single data line for transmission
Data integrity depends on accurate baud rate timing
Common baud rates include:
4800, 9600, 19200, 57600, 115200-Protocol
