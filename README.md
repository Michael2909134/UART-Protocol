# UART-Protocol
Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART):
UART is a widely used asynchronous serial communication protocol that enables the transmission of data without a shared clock signal. It uses two main lines—TX (Transmit) and RX (Receive)—to send and receive data one bit at a time. A typical UART data frame consists of a start bit, 8 data bits, an optional parity bit, and one or more stop bits.
Its simplicity and low hardware requirements make UART ideal for short-distance, low-speed communication in embedded systems. UART includes three primary components:
•	Transmitter (TX): Converts parallel data into a serial stream.
•	Receiver (RX): Reconstructs the serial stream into parallel data.
•	Baud Rate Generator: Ensures synchronized data rate between devices.
UART is extensively used in GPS modules, Bluetooth modules, and serial ports of computers due to its easy implementation and cost efficiency.
